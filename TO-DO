A list of some foreseen changes and additions:
======================================
- Find a way to move the ants. (IN PROGRESS)
- Add ant sprites.
	- This includes walking animations.
- Add block sprites.
	- This includes item sprites.
- Determine if there's a difference between blocks on the screen and placeable items.
	- There probably should be. When we get to the removal of items, we don't want to remove the foundation blocks that were already there when the level was loaded.
	- This gives the question of where the items will be stored.
		- Like the ants, they could be separate. It's easy enough to determine which block we're using simply by looking at the x and y values of the item/ant.
- The above just reminded me: Flip the grid of blocks (if it's not already flipped).
	- Right now, the map is probably flipped vertically from the way it's read.
- Some blocks will have very similar rules. For example: The slanted tiles and the slanted item. Both are walked over diagonally.
	- How do we deal with this?
